== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do add icons to the buttons? =

Just enter the name of the icon into the 'icon' parameter. You can find a name of all the available icons here:
[Font Awesome Cheatsheet](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/cheatsheet)

For example: If you want to add a star icon to the button, just add *icon="star"* to the shortcode.
There's no need to prefix it with 'icon-', if you do, the icon won't display.

If you look inside of the */css/font-awesome.css* file, at the very bottom you'll find some social icons you can also use.
